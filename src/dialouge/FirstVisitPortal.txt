Magic Merchant;50;We're here.€ You need to spend the souls to bring the ancient magic into motion.
Player;50;What then?
Magic Merchant;50;Then, you enter and fight.€ This gate is dialed to take you to closed spaces.€ Dungeons, labyrinths, castles and the sort.€ You must reach the final chamber and fight whatever is in there.
Player;50;Will this always cost me 10.000 souls?
Magic Merchant;50;No.€ This is to kickstart the gate.€ Time is the major factor in your visits.€ Activating the gate sends it into a cooldown of sorts.€ You can however shorten it if you provide souls to do so.€ That is all.€ From now I will start digging through old inventory to find magic items that can help you.
Player;50;Thank you.€ Then let's see if this still works
;50;<Expending souls>
;50;<Mechanism whirrs to life>
Magic Merchant;50;Merlin's beard.€ It still lives.€
Player;50;You weren't sure?
Magic Merchant;50;Not by a long shot.€ Anywho, we've no time to waste.€ Good luck.
